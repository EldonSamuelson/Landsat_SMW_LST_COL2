Land Surface Temperature from Landsat on Google Earth Engine. **This is the original Collection 1 forked master, with no changes since 10th December 2020.** 

The Original Author has updated their code on GEE since my project was started, [take a look at it here](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?scriptPath=users%2Fsofiaermida%2Flandsat_smw_lst%3Aexample_1.js)

My [tributary branch](https://github.com/EldonSamuelson/Landsat_SMW_LST_COL2/tree/tributary#readme) contains my own personal changes since [July 7th 2022](https://i.imgur.com/mK4y5m0.png).
